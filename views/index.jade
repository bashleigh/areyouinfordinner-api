                    p Well, I built an app for that. I got fed up of the "I said I was in for dinner tonight!" argument with my mum every night and going hungry.
                    p As well as the "I didn't know you was going to be in" argument when I made dinner for myself only.

                    h1.title How it works
                    p The idea is simple. You receive a notification from the app around 12pm prompting you with a yes and no question as to if you're in for dinner or not. Then again at 3pm.
                    p If you don't answer before 5pm the app presumes you're not in for dinner and sends a notification to everyone in the group as to how many people are in for dinner for that particular day.
